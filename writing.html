  <strong><h1>The Oldest Rectangle</h1></strong>
<h2>This is a short creative writing by me that has a theme of 'city'.<br>
I didn't have a plan for writing it since I was inspired suddenly and wrote it right off the bat.</h2>

<p class="w">
  The city rotates. A round, three rounds, two hours, four days and it goes around the universe. Origins embed itself spouting black oil from the ground. Small dark-shining crystals hold their hands and lie down on the world. Above there are the white guards, and the yellow soldiers divide their territories. Time emerges in the disaggregated space. The clock practices. It agonizes over walking and running but draws a circle. There creates life in the endless movement. People of diverse lights stand on shapes in diverse colors. We look around each other but we can't see another's eyes. Angles are bumped into themselves yelling. Another sound comes out of the wound and it sings its own song. By the preference and who the singer is, the air closes its ears and breathes out irritation. The irritation may stay in the water or give birth to death by occurring anger. People run and hide in the place where four walls cover them. The green can be faced when getting outside. Green rides on the wind and becomes blue. The blue has stolen its smile, and we open our eyes at last. When we walk, the tears adhere to our feet but we sprinkle them while running. Anyone can be a musician. However, we must not mimic other's music. It's because we can distort emotions. We encounter the unhearing sound then meet friends. We run for a while and face the clock with friends whom we can meet with closed eyes. If the clock is broken we fix it and bring another clock. Our walls are applied with full adhesive. The disease hides behind the adhesive secretly and tries to read the minds. The green and the blue glance at it, and we should go next to them quickly as possible. Like an adhesive. Small friends know the way to meet the green and the blue. They tell us about it but we can't notice if the clock isn't with us. It's made when we close our eyes running, and open our eyes stopping. The oldest rectangle crosses the night and reaches the day.
